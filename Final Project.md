# Final Project: Large Counties - Did they all vote for Biden? 
## Overview
In the 2020 election, as well as in most recent elections, large cities in the USA overwhelmingly have voted for the Democrat candidate. 
Looking at the an election map usually shows a largely red map, with the occaional blue dots in the large cities. However as with all data, there is still a lot of
variation to be explained. Many studies of course allready analyzed the relationship beween socioeconomic-status, education, ethnicity etc. and voting behiavior. 
With foursquare we have the opportunity of a totally different kind of analysis. Instead of analysing the impact of population characteristics on voting behavior,
we can explore if voting behavior is related to the kinds of venues different areas are made up of. We are going to use the Foursquare API to collect information
on venues within the large counties. We are going to cluster the counties by their venues and use machine-learning to predict how those counties voted in the 2020 
presidential election.
