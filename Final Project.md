# Final Project: Large Counties - Did they all vote for Biden? 
## Overview
In the 2020 election, as well as in most recent elections, large cities in the USA overwhelmingly have voted for the Democrat candidate. 
Looking at the an election map usually shows a largely red map, with the occaional blue dots in the large cities. However as with all data, there is still a lot of
variation to be explained. Many studies of course allready analyzed the relationship beween socioeconomic-status, education, ethnicity etc. and voting behiavior. 
With foursquare we have the opportunity of a totally different kind of analysis. Instead of analysing the impact of population characteristics on voting behavior,
we can explore if voting behavior is related to the kinds of venues different areas are made up of. We are going to use the Foursquare API to collect information
on venues within the large counties. We are going to cluster the counties by their venues and use machine-learning to predict how those counties voted in the 2020 
presidential election.
## Background and Problem Description
When watching the election coverage in the year 2020, there were quite a few very interesting facts about voting behavior to observe. Besides the obvious red states and blue states which stay the same every election cycle with only small variations, we could see again the large difference between rural areas and metropolitan areas - the rural areas overwhelmingly voting for Trump and the metropolitan areas overwhelmingly voting for Biden. Because vote count reporting does not happen all at once or consistently distributed over the country, but actually happens in large chunks at a time, we observed very dramatical changes throughout election night and the week afterwards. For example Biden started with a large lead in the state of Texas early election night, which shocked many Trump-voters. When we looked at the counties that reported results, we could see that the lead was due to the fact that almost only Dallas - a large city - was reporting results. Later Texas went to Trump quite clearly. A similar thing happend in the state of Ohio - a must win for Trump - where Biden had a lead for a long period of time, before the rural areas were reporting the results and Trump again won quite considerably. The most dramatic shifts happened in the night from December 3rd to December 4th. Trump went into the night with massive leads in Pensylvenia and Michigan, and a considerable lead in Wisconsin and allready declared himself winner, only to lose those states after large amounts of absentee ballots in the largest cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwuakee were counted. 
In my analysis I want to focus more deeply on the voting behavior in the large counties. As stated above, those are overwhelmingly democrat counties.
